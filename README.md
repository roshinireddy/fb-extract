This project involves conversion of unstructured data into structured data by importing it into OpenMRS database using java code

Social networks like Facebook helps to connect with friends, family and co-workers. Earlier social networks have far reaching implications in the domain of health which is traditionally dictated by strict one to one communication between the doctor and patient. However now-a-days there are many Facebook groups which discuss about the medical cases with their fellow physicians which improved the scope of learning for the budding healthcare professionals. Tabula Rasa is a good platform foe doctors, medical students, patients. Although analysis of the discussions involved in the page is a big task. No analysis can be done on this unstructured data. Hence, this unstructured data should be converted into structured data. In this study, unstructured data (case records) was converted into structured data and analyzed using visit note analysis in openMRS(an open source EHR).
